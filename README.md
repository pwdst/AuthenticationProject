# AuthenticationProject

Custom MVC 6 authentication project using direct ADO.NET

This project was original done in July 2015 as a example project to demonstrate secure user authentication and storing credentials in a database without relying on a ORM. It has been re-written in March 2016 to reflect changes to ASP.NET Core (as is) and MVC 6 since the original date.

Please note that this project is **not intended to be an example of how to implement authentication in production code**. I strongly urge that developers who are not security specialists do not attempt to *roll their own encryption*.

There are excellent authentication frameworks such as [ASP.NET Identity](http://www.asp.net/identity) which have the benefit of specialist oversight and will be updated as the threat environment evolves.
